title: Examples, Keep it Simple Stupid

# Examples- Keep it simple, stupid

The examples that are presented in this notebook or that are hosted on a repository
have been too complex. I need to keep the [KISS][wp1] in mind when creating them,
in other words "keep it small and simple" and "Keep it simple, stupid".

Benefits: 
- **Less includes**:
Removing unrelated content will make the overall size of the project smaller.
- **Less to maintain**:
Likewise, if unrelated code changes it should not cause the example to have to be
rewritten.
- **Easier to understand**
Readers of the code or notes about the code will not be intimidated by the amount
of code.
