# Maintain File by Hash

It has been a lot of work to maintain and I do not think its worth it. I will be
removing this directory and relying on git functionality for obtaining these files
later. The projects may still be listed with the HASHs listed; this would allow
me to later find the files with those same hashes, if I needed to rerun that 
exact instance of the project.
