Preparing a repository for github (remove auth tokens and sensitive information)

I need to put a respository online that contains sensitive information. I looked
at git-filter methods of removing this content. While that may work in the future,
I have created a complete solution in bash that will allow me to do it for now.
I am working on a bash script to do this but have decided to put it off for now.
