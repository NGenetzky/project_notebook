title: Ideas About Day Markdown

A strangely formatted note that discusses possible organization of discussions
about things in the notebook.

# Ideas About Day Markdown

Ideas I have about the files in the format "YYYY-MM-DD.md".

## Level 2 Headings

Should be an object type. Such as: notes, projects, code, files, etc.

### Cateory within the object

#### Group of the object
Examples are: projects contain code, directories contain files, notebooks
contain notes

##### Name of Object
Should name the object. This should have a anchor with a name attribute.
