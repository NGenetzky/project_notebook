I am looking through all of the hardware I have in my tool chest. I am attaching
ideas to projects I could do with them. I wanted to do this so that I could
possibly inspire some ideas of what I could do for Senior design.

I would later like to come back to this note and attach the photo of all the
components on my desk. I attached sticky notes to them to make it easier to
tell what it could be used for.
