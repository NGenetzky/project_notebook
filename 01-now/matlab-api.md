## Matlab API

## Brainstorming Improvements
Consider a struct that has all of the variables defined on the micro controller.
As shown already in the current version of **Particle()** exposed the **do** cmds.

With the variables defined in matlab and with a easy way to modify them from 
matlab; basicly you have control over the micro controller variables.

I think the most important thing would be to have a very constant interface between
the Matlab and the Particle device.
