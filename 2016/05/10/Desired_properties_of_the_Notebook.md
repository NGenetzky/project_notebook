The intent of this notebook is to provide a log of my progress as I work through
projects. The main feature of the notebook is to show my original notes as I work
through the project. There must be a balance between usability and auditability.

### Usability
It is important that I can quickly add a note to the notebook. I need to be able 
quickly write but have visually appealing results, and therefore I will use
Markdown syntax in my writing. By using an electronic notebook I should be able
to easily provide reference to electronic files. These files could be stored
internally to the notebook or should be stored in an appropriate location. This
location should be permanently accessable and support a similar amount of
auditability.

### Auditability
In order to provide the highest auditability a file copy should exists that can
to have been written at or before a particular instance in time. Github provides
this feature automatically by the use of commits. 

### Revisions
I am human, and all humans make mistakes. There must be a way to edit previous
notes without affecting the Auditability. Foremost, a copy of the original file
must be kept. Revisions to the files could be stored as the *diff* between
that revision and the original.

### Privacy
I must be careful not to allow sensitive information to be entered into the
notebook. Some method should be in place to allow that information to be removed
from the notebook.
