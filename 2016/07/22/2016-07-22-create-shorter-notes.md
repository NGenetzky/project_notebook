I plan to try to write more notes in my project notebook, but to try to keep them
more brief. I think that I should write "too many" notes and then regularly
revisit past notes to determine whether they can be combined into something worth
presenting.

In fact I would like to utilize the GTD methodology. It has proved to be a very
useful way to deal with pending actions. The previous paragraph reflects the
first pillar of GTD, **Capture**.
