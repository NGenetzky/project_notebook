I have created a repository for both docx and images. Currently I have put a
word document in in various formats. Then I also have the derivative of that
content as well. The PDF view of the document would always be a good reference
if other sources fail.


I also think there should be a Onedrive folder. The notes in this folder should
contain yaml front matter that describes the id from OneDrive. The document it's
self could be the content of the post.
