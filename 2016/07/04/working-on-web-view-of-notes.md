Working on improving the presentation of my notes. Currently my notes are hosted
at [github pages][mm].

## Online Markdown (kramdown) Editor

While I am working on fixing my notes I am finding a lot of invalid syntax.
It could be helpful to use an [online editor][kramdown] to verify the markdown
syntax before posting.

## Tips for writing better markdown 

- Leave excessive space around special things like lists, code blocks, and quotes.
- Always use links in format:

```markdown
[displayed][unique_per_doc]

[unique_per_doc]: www.example.com
```
